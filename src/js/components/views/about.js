         <p>The goal of this project is to make history personal for our community and encourage people to take ownership of their past. By creating an interactive platform for story sharing, this project will allow participants to share their memories and learn more about the history that surrounds them. Voices of Nashville will not only explore the overlaps in our own personal histories but also allow individuals to consider the meaning of "the past" in our technology driven society as they read stories that date from hundreds of years ago to yesterday.</p>
         <p>To add a new story please click ADD STORY on the top right of the page to begin sharing your own personal history.</p>
